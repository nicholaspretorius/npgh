I have been a longtime reader of Fred Wilson's blog, [AVC](https://avc.com/). Over the years, it has started to become one of my favourite reads and I look forward to his posts on a daily basis. His recent post, [Capitalism and Inequality](https://avc.com/2019/01/capitalism-and-inequality/), stuck with me for different reasons than usual though. It succeeded as a thought provoking piece, but I felt it missed the mark. 


As an example, take the remarkable [closing credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yedfKGZ7do) of the 2010 comedy [The Other Guys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386588/). In particular, the animation that records the exponentially growing salary ratio of CEO to average employee: 

* In 1921, the credits list the ratio as 9:1. 
* By 2010 the ratio was 319:1. 


If the average CEO salary has multiplied over 35 times between 1921 - 2010, how many times has the average employee's salary multiplied? 


Executives* have within their immediate power, the ability to address the inequality of that 319-1 pay ratio. The inability or unwillingness to do so is immoral. 


**I use the term 'executives' to represent `those with power`. They could be founders, CEOs, C-level executives, board members, investors or similar.*
