I completed the first course's materials in the Udacity React Nanodegree program today. After spending the first few sections getting up to speed with the basics, the content today covered [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start), paticularly, react-router-dom. To finalise this section of the course, there is a practical course project to consolidate the course content so far. As part of the requirements, Udacity has styelguides to adhere to when coding for this. Here they are: 

* [HTML](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html)
* [CSS](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html)
* [JavaScript](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html)
* [Git](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)

In particular, I found the Git commit styleguide of interest since, to date, I have not worked on a project with a Git-specific guideline. Granted, I have worked on projects with guidelines on repo-usage, but we did not have such detailed instructions. I think I will make use of these in future:

* feat: a new feature
* fix: a bug fix
* docs: changes to documentation
* style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
* refactor: refactoring production code
* test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
* chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change
