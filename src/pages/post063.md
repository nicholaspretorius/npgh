For many years I have progressively been expanding my programming skillset. While much of this learning process has been through personal programming projects and online courses, as I reflected on my learning process, I realised that much of this learning was hard to see plainly. As a result, I decided to mark that journey with some form of official certifications. 

While I have worked in web development for just over a decade, much of that time was spent on frontend development. Despite wearing many hats and playing various roles on many projects, I felt there were still significant pieces of the development experience that I was missing. As such, I went through a process of taking stock of where my skills were at, and where I wanted them to be. This process included identifying and prioritising the gaps in my experience along with a plan for filling them. Through this process I identified 3 key areas of focus: 

1. Backend development
2. Cloud computing
3. Mobile development

### Backend Development

As a frontend developer for the majority of my career, I had the feeling that I could not truly become a "real" programmer, nor understand the full scope of the development lifecycle without having significant experience of backend development. Additionally, fullstack development is a widely valued skill, whether it be the fact that you can build an entire product on your own, or the flexibility the fullstack skillset provides to an employer, having the skill and experience to contribute through the entire stack is significant. While I had been working with Node.js in production, had some experience with PHP as well as working with Java teams for much of my career, I felt I needed to level-up my programming knowledge by diving into the deep end of backend programming. 

### Cloud Computing

Having learned and worked within the Azure cloud environment for the preceding two years, the value and necessity of cloud computing concepts was obvious to me. As a result, I felt a strong desire to expand on my cloud foundations by exploring other cloud environments and to push myself into uncomfortable territories by applying my development work into new cloud environments. 

### Mobile Development

While iOS and Android have dominated the computing landscape for a decade, my experience and contribution to mobile computing has primarily been through creating mobile-friendly, responsive web applications. As such, I have almost no knowledge and experience in the development lifecycle of a mobile app. Considering that the major computing evolution of the last decade was a black hole in my development experience, I felt a strong urge to plug this gap by learning more about building mobile apps (whether Hybrid or Native). 

### Planning

With the process of taking stock of my skills complete, and the priorities highlighted, I went about deciding on how best to achieve my goals. Ultimately, I decided on certification as a means to both force myself to learn new skills, as well as provide some form of validation of that skill. With 10 years of experience in development I felt that was enough credential to certify me as a good colleague, employee and contibutor of code, however, without much experience outside of frontend development, earning certifications was a way for me to kickstart the process. As such, I decided on using Udacity for this purpose. While Udacity may or may not appeal to some people, their proposition appealed to me for 3 reasons: 

1. They offered certification
2. They required you to complete practical projects that were code-reviewed by real people
3. They provided personal mentors to whom you could direct questions to

Considering the cost of Udacity courses, I then needed to narrow my field of options down to 3 courses, namely: 

1. React Developer 
2. Full Stack Developer
3. Cloud Developer


### React Developer

I decided to do the React Developer course primarily because front end development was already familiar to me, as was JavaScript: 

1. Many of the companies I look up to use React. Having worked in the Angular environment for many years, I was very curious to see how it differed in terms of development. 
2. With my stated goal of learning mobile development, I felt that learning React would provide a relatively accessible entrypoint to learning mobile development through React Native.
3. Learning React Native would itself provide a crossing over point to potential native mobile development by enabling me to build apps with JavaScript while getting a sense of what is and is not possible through that avenue. 

### Fullstack Developer

Becoming a skilled backend developer is important to me. While JavaScript had been my bread and butter for some time, my journeys into PHP and Java had not borne significant fruit. Node.js was incredibly exciting to me and I was developing my backend skills rapidly using Node.js. That being said, I felt that I would only truly be able to lay claim to being a "real" developer if I had knowledge of a completely different programming language. Considering the available options, I felt Python was the best choice: 

1. I had already dipped my toe into Python by building a very basic API using Python and Flask and enjoyed the experience. 
2. Python is incredibly popular these days and is used widely through different areas of development. 
3. Much of the AI/Machine Learning environment seemed to be based in Python. 

### Cloud Developer

Cloud development is, in my view, the only viable game in town these days. Whether working at a startup, or within a large organisation, both are equally looking towards cloud development as primary vehicle for software development. As such, having the skill and knowledge to leverage cloud platforms is critical! Furthermore, AWS is the leading cloud provider and having worked with Azure for some time I was very keen to learn about the other platforms. Looking at Udacity's offerings made the choice easy: 

1. The Cloud Developer course covered important topics I had dabbled in such as Docker and containers, and covered topics I knew nothing about, but was eager to learn such as Kubernetes and Serverless development. 
2. The Udacity course comes with an AWS credit plan making it more attractive should there be some cost generated by my use of AWS. 
3. The course projects looked interesting to me.
