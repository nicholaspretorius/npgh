I really like Lodash. Granted, there might be some who would prefer to write the necessary code from scratch, and this certainly is a good option for learning, but my feeling is that Lodash is a tool and if it is available and the context is right, you should at least try it out.  

Here are a few functions I found useful this week: 

* [_.debounce](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce)
* [_.unionBy](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#unionBy)
* [_.differenceBy](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#differenceBy)
* [_.flatten](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#flatten)

See [here](/til0081) for a few more.
