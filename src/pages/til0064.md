[Simple React Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=burkeholland.simple-react-snippets) is a VS Code Extensions by Burke Holland which, in a manner similar to Emmet enables you to tab out shortcode into code snippets.

For example, pressing tab after typing out the following:

`imrc`

Will give you:

`import React, { Component } from 'react';`

Similarly, typing `cc`, then hitting tab will give you:

```
class extends Component {
    state = {  }
    render() {
        return (  );
    }
}

export default ;
```


What's great about this, is that the snippet will expand with double-cursors active in the place where you enter the className which makes it super simple to create your boilerplate. Once the className is typed you press the 'esc' key and cursor will go back to single cursor mode. Very cool!
