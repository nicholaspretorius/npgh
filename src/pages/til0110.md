### Heroku. 

These are some of the basic Heroku commans to keep in mind once you have the Heroku CLI installed: 

* heroku -v // provides you with version info
* heroku auth:whoami // displays who you are currently logged in as
* heroku info app-name-here // provides you with info about your app
* heroku open // opens the app you are working on
* heroku create // creates a new Heroku app and links the Git repo to yours i.e. you do not need to add a remote
* git remote -v // if you want to check which Git remotes you have
* heroku logs // displays the logs
* heroku releases -a app-name-here // displays details of the releases of the app on Heroku
* heroku status // lets you know if there are any known issues on the platform at present
* git push heroku master // will deploy your app from master to Heroku
