While I have been a longtime user of Google Sheets. My usage has not been very deep. Mostly just making lists of things I like to keep track of. However, with the discovery of the wonderful app called [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/), my usage of Google Sheets has increased dramatically! 


#### Filter.

Filter is a very useful formula enabling you to *filter* your view of data. For example: 

```=filter(SheetName!A:E,Sheet!E:E=TRUE)```

This will pull data in from columns A to E in SheetName and will then display all items that have a value of TRUE in Column E of that same sheet. 

#### Unique.

Unique enables you to pull out *unique* values from a list of values. For example: 

```=UNIQUE(SheetName!I2:I)```

This will pull all unique values in from SheetName Column I from rows 2 to as many rows as I contains. 

#### Sort.

Sort lets you, well, *sort* data in your sheet. I tend to use it to sort data from another sheet. For example: 

```=SORT(SheetName!A2:F, 4, true)```

This will sort data from SheetName in the range of Columns A to F.
