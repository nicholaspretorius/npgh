A real "Today I Learned" for a change: Occassionally you may get NPM *shouting* at you about access permissions. If you do, try running the following (Hat Tip to the ever knowledgeable [Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/npm-fix-missing-write-access-error/)):

`sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules`

In my case, the above did not work, however, you should try running this on your user account .npm folder too: 

`sudo chown -R $USER /User/Username/.npm`
