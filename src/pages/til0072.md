I have become a big fan of Markdown! 

1. It's the de-facto standard for readme files, and having spent a considerable amount of time working in Git and becoming accustomed to Git and GitHub conventions, Markdown has become a daily part of life. 
2. This blog itself is powered by Markdown, and of late, I have been writing to it daily which has lead to me becoming increasingy accustomed to the conventions. 
3. As I have gotten more familiar with Markdown, it has started to find its way into my commit messages, pull request comments and much else besides since BitBucket, Confluence, GitHub and Azure Devops all support Markdown. 
4. Being a longtime reader of [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net) by John Gruber, the creator of Markdown, I like the fact that I have finally become a regular user of Markdown.
5. I love the name!
