Now that I am getting going with Sketch again. Below are some notes on my setup:

### Sketch Version.

I had long since upgraded my version, as such, I bought a new license and upgraded to the latest version which is 53 (at the time of writing). 

### Source Control.

For source control, I decided to try out [Versions by Sympli](https://versions.sympli.io/). 

[Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) seems to be the preferred tool, however, working as a solo designer, I do not feel the need to use this software just yet. After some investigation, I decided to give Versions a go since it is Git based and free to use.

### Plugins

After some further investigation, I installed the following plugins to assist with workflow: 

#### Sketch Runner. 

[Sketch Runner](https://sketchrunner.com/) is a fantastic plugin! It reminds me of CMD + P in VS Code or Spotlight on Mac. 

#### Craft by InVision.

I have long been a fan of [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) for creating clickable prototypes (aka clickdummies), so it made sense to give [Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft) a shot.

#### Sketch Palettes. 

[Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes) is a simple plugin to manage and import color palettes with support for colours, gradients and pattern fills. 


#### Content Generator.

[Content Generator](https://github.com/timuric/Content-generator-sketch-plugin) has some overlap with Craft, but I like the simplicity of it.
