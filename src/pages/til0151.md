I first came across the [Roost Laptop Stand](https://www.therooststand.com/) after reading a [blog post](https://krausefx.com/blog/going-nomad) by Felix Krause where he mentioned it (see the section titled "Did you buy any travel gear for this?"). 

I was impressed by what what I saw and read about the stand and made a mental note to check to consider purchasing one in future. I promptly forgot about it. 

A few weeks ago, Tim Ferris mentioned the Roost Laptop Stand in his [5-Bullet Friday](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday-1/) newsletter and I was reminded of it once more. Over the past year, I have spent a considerable amount of time working on a laptop, and due to bad posture and sitting habits, I have picked up back pain that has caused me quite a lot of discomfort in recent months. 

As a result, after taking another look at some reviews, I decided to take the plunge and order one from Amazon. I am looking forward to this piece of kit. While it won't make me a better developer, I sure hope it will help my posture!

Note: I originally wanted to order the stand directly from Roost, but the shipping was more than the stand itself.
