Mike Wuerthele wrote an [article at AppleInsider](http://appleinsider.com/articles/18/01/19/if-iphone-x-demand-is-less-than-expected-analyst-expects-it-to-be-end-of-life-when-replacements-ship) about a KGI Securities research note regarding the iPhone X titled:

"If iPhone X demand is less than expected, analyst expects it to be 'end of life' when replacements ship"

The "internet" then decided that this meant the iPhone X would be cancelled due to weak sales.

My advice is to read Wuerthele's article from bottom to top for a better understanding of what KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo is actually saying.

Here is my summary:

* Analyst expects trio of iPhone models in 2018 with possible launch of iPhone X Plus.
* Current iPhone X is unlikely to be retained in line-up once replaced.
* Notch may be affecting impact in China.
* Shipments of 18 million iPhone Xs expected in Q1.
* No comment on holiday sales.
* Analyst expects 10% iPhone growth in 2018.
* Firm remains positive on the Apple and the iPhone supply chain.


Don't believe the clickbait.
