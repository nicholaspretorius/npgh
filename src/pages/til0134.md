Now that I have some experience creating React end-to-end (e2e) tests with Cypress, I have been looking into ways of doing the same with React Native. After some investigation, I found some great resources to get you started with [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox):

* [This article](https://blog.logrocket.com/end-to-end-testing-in-react-native-with-detox/) by Emanuel Suriano on the LogRocket blog provides a great overview. 
* For a comprehensive overview of the basics, [this site](https://reactnativetesting.io/) by Josh Justice (great superhero name) is indispensible. 
* Running Detox on Expo apps is not exactly the same as with React Native Client though, so the aforementioned Josh Justice has another great article just for that [here](https://blog.expo.io/testing-expo-apps-with-detox-and-react-native-testing-library-7fbdbb82ac87)!*
* Finally, this is a useful answer on [Stack Exchange](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54834078/4847180) on setting up Detox with Expo.


*Note: I have come across Josh Justice's work before, and I highly recommend taking a look. It is [his article](https://learntdd.in/react/) on getting started with React and Cypress that got me going on the basics of e2e testing.
