Some useful examples on basic SQL usage: 

Based on the following [ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/October/59e946e7_erd/erd.png)

#### All.

`SELECT * from orders;`

#### Column selectors.

`SELECT id, account_id, occurred_at
FROM orders;`

#### Using limit. 

`SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;`

#### Combined.

`SELECT occurred_at, account_id, channel
FROM web_events
LIMIT 15;`

#### Order by. 

Default is ASC.

`SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 10;`


#### ASC.

`SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 10;`

#### Examples: 

Write a query to return the top 5 orders in terms of largest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd:

`SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 10;`

Write a query to return the lowest 20 orders in terms of smallest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd:

`SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd
LIMIT 20;`

Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted first by the account ID (in ascending order), and then by the total dollar amount (in descending order):

`SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id, total_amt_usd DESC;`

Now write a query that again displays order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in descending order), and then by account ID (in ascending order):

`SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC, account_id;`

Pulls the first 5 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a dollar amount of gloss_amt_usd greater than or equal to 1000:

`SELECT * 
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_amt_usd >= 1000
LIMIT 5;`

Pulls the first 10 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a total_amt_usd less than 500:

`SELECT * 
FROM orders
WHERE total_amt_usd < 500
LIMIT 10;`

Filter the accounts table to include the company name, website, and the primary point of contact (primary_poc) just for the Exxon Mobil company in the accounts table:

`SELECT name, website, primary_poc
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE 'Exxon Mobil';`

OR

`SELECT name, website, primary_poc
FROM accounts
WHERE name = 'Exxon Mobil';`

Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields:

`SELECT id, account_id, standard_amt_usd/standard_qty AS "Unit Price"
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;`

OR

`SELECT id, account_id, standard_amt_usd/standard_qty AS unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;`

Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue that comes from poster paper for each order. You will need to use only the columns that end with _usd. (Try to do this without using the total column.) Display the id and account_id fields also:

`SELECT id, account_id, 
   poster_amt_usd/(standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd + poster_amt_usd) AS post_per
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;`

All the companies whose names start with 'C':

`SELECT id, name, website 
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE 'C%';`

All companies whose names contain the string 'one' somewhere in the name:

`SELECT id, name, website 
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE '%one%';`

All companies whose names end with 's':

`SELECT id, name, website 
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE '%s';`

Use the accounts table to find the account name, primary_poc, and sales_rep_id for Walmart, Target, and Nordstrom:

`SELECT name, primary_poc, sales_rep_id
FROM accounts
WHERE name IN ('Walmart', 'Target', 'Nordstrom')
ORDER BY name;`

Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via the channel of organic or adwords:

`SELECT *
FROM web_events
WHERE channel IN ('organic', 'adwords')
ORDER BY id;`

Use the accounts table to find the account name, primary poc, and sales rep id for all stores except Walmart, Target, and Nordstrom:

`SELECT name, primary_poc, sales_rep_id 
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT IN ('Walmart', 'Target', 'Nordstrom')
ORDER BY name;`

Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via any method except using organic or adwords methods:

`SELECT *
FROM web_events
WHERE channel NOT IN ('organic', 'adwords')
ORDER BY id;`

All the companies whose names do not start with 'C':

`SELECT name, id
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'C%'
ORDER BY name;`

All companies whose names do not contain the string 'one' somewhere in the name:

`SELECT name, id
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT LIKE '%one%'
ORDER BY name;`

All companies whose names do not end with 's':

`SELECT name, id
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT LIKE '%s'
ORDER BY name;`

Write a query that returns all the orders where the standard_qty is over 1000, the poster_qty is 0, and the gloss_qty is 0:

`SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE standard_qty > 1000 AND poster_qty = 0 AND gloss_qty = 0;`

Using the accounts table, find all the companies whose names do not start with 'C' and end with 's':

`SELECT name, id, website
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'C%' AND name LIKE '%s'
ORDER BY name;`

Query that displays the order date and gloss_qty data for all orders where gloss_qty is between 24 and 29:

With BETWEEN:

`SELECT occurred_at, gloss_qty
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_qty BETWEEN 24 AND 29
ORDER BY gloss_qty;`

Without:

`SELECT occurred_at, gloss_qty
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_qty > 24 AND gloss_qty < 29
ORDER BY gloss_qty;`

Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via the organic or adwords channels, and started their account at any point in 2016, sorted from newest to oldest:

`SELECT * 
FROM web_events
WHERE channel IN ('organic', 'adwords') AND occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z' AND '2016-12-31T11:59:59.000Z'
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC;`

OR

`SELECT *
FROM web_events
WHERE channel IN ('organic', 'adwords') AND occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC;`

Find list of orders ids where either gloss_qty or poster_qty is greater than 4000:

`SELECT id, gloss_qty, poster_qty 
FROM orders 
WHERE gloss_qty > 4000 OR poster_qty > 4000;`

Write a query that returns a list of orders where the standard_qty is zero and either the gloss_qty or poster_qty is over 1000:

`SELECT id, standard_qty, gloss_qty, poster_qty 
FROM orders 
WHERE standard_qty = 0 AND (gloss_qty > 1000 OR poster_qty > 1000);`

Find all the company names that start with a 'C' or 'W', and the primary contact contains 'ana' or 'Ana', but it doesn't contain 'eana':

`SELECT id, name, primary_poc
FROM accounts 
WHERE (name LIKE 'C%' OR name LIKE 'W%') 
AND ((primary_poc LIKE '%ana%' OR primary_poc LIKE '%Ana%') AND (primary_poc NOT LIKE '%eana%'));`

`SELECT *
FROM accounts
WHERE (name LIKE 'C%' OR name LIKE 'W%') 
           AND ((primary_poc LIKE '%ana%' OR primary_poc LIKE '%Ana%') 
           AND primary_poc NOT LIKE '%eana%');`


#### JOINs.

`SELECT orders.*
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;`

Only name from accounts and occurred_at from orders:

`SELECT accounts.name, orders.occurred_at
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;`

All the data from the accounts table, and all the data from the orders table:

`SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;`

All data from orders only:

`SELECT orders.*
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;`

Standard_qty, gloss_qty, and poster_qty from the orders table, and the website and the primary_poc from the accounts table:

`SELECT orders.standard_qty, orders.gloss_qty, orders.poster_qty, accounts.website, accounts.primary_poc
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id; `

More options:

`SELECT orders.account_id, orders.total_amt_usd, accounts.name
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id
ORDER BY orders.total_amt_usd DESC;`

Join three tables with all data:

`SELECT *
FROM web_events
JOIN accounts
ON web_events.account_id = accounts.id
JOIN orders
ON accounts.id = orders.account_id`

#### Aliases.

`SELECT o.standard_qty, o.gloss_qty, o.poster_qty, a.website, a.primary_poc
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id; `

Provide a table for all web_events associated with account name of Walmart. There should be three columns. Be sure to include the primary_poc, time of the event, and the channel for each event. Additionally, you might choose to add a fourth column to assure only Walmart events were chosen:

`SELECT a.name, a.primary_poc, w.channel
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON w.account_id = a.id
WHERE a.name LIKE 'Walmart';`

A table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name:

`SELECT 
r.name region_name,
s.name rep_name, 
a.name account_name
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
ORDER BY account_name;`

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. A few accounts have 0 for total, so I divided by (total + 0.01) to assure not dividing by zero:

`SELECT 
region.name region_name,
accounts.name account_name,
(orders.total_amt_usd/(orders.total + 0.01)) AS unit_price
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id
JOIN sales_reps
ON accounts.sales_rep_id = sales_reps.id
JOIN region
ON sales_reps.region_id = region.id;`

Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. This time only for the Midwest region. Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name:

`SELECT 
r.name region_name, 
s.name rep_name, 
a.name account_name
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON r.id = s.region_id
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY a.name;`


Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a first name starting with S and in the Midwest region. Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name:

`SELECT 
r.name region_name, 
s.name rep_name, 
a.name account_name
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON r.id = s.region_id
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
WHERE s.name LIKE 'S%' AND r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY a.name;`

Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a last name starting with K and in the Midwest region. Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name:

`SELECT 
r.name region_name, 
s.name rep_name, 
a.name account_name
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON r.id = s.region_id
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
WHERE s.name LIKE '% K%' AND r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY a.name;`

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the standard order quantity exceeds 100. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. In order to avoid a division by zero error, adding .01 to the denominator here is helpful total_amt_usd/(total+0.01):

`SELECT 
r.name region_name,
a.name account_name,
(o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01)) unit_price
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100;`

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the standard order quantity exceeds 100 and the poster order quantity exceeds 50. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. Sort for the smallest unit price first. In order to avoid a division by zero error, adding .01 to the denominator here is helpful (total_amt_usd/(total+0.01):

`SELECT 
r.name region_name,
a.name account_name,
(o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01)) unit_price
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100 AND o.poster_qty > 50
ORDER BY unit_price;`

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the standard order quantity exceeds 100 and the poster order quantity exceeds 50. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. Sort for the largest unit price first. In order to avoid a division by zero error, adding .01 to the denominator here is helpful (total_amt_usd/(total+0.01):

`SELECT 
r.name region_name,
a.name account_name,
(o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01)) unit_price
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100 AND o.poster_qty > 50
ORDER BY unit_price DESC;`

What are the different channels used by account id 1001? Your final table should have only 2 columns: account name and the different channels. You can try SELECT DISTINCT to narrow down the results to only the unique values:

`SELECT DISTINCT
a.name,
w.channel
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON w.account_id = a.id
WHERE w.account_id = 1001;`

Find all the orders that occurred in 2015. Your final table should have 4 columns: occurred_at, account name, order total, and order total_amt_usd:

`SELECT 
o.occurred_at date,
a.name account,
o.total total,
o.total_amt_usd amount
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.occurred_at BETWEEN '2015-01-01' AND '2015-12-31'
ORDER BY date;'
