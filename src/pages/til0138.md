Just a quick one today, when using GitLab CI/CD for managing your pipelines, be sure to validate your .gitlab-ci.yml file before committing it to your repo or pushing it to GitLab for building. 

In the CI/CD left-hand menu section, under "Pipinelines" you will find a "CI Lint" button at the top right. Clicking it will take you to a page containing a large textarea in which to paste your entire .gitlab-ci.yml code. Once pasted, click the "Validate" button. 

If you have any issues in your .yml file, you will see relevant validation messages and you can correct as needed. 

Taking the time to check this when making pipeline changes, before pushing your code to GitLab, will definitely save you time and unnecessary build failures!
