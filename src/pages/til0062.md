These are some Redis cheat sheet notes:

#### Installation

* ```wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-5.0.3.tar.gz```
* ```tar xzf redis-5.0.3.tar.gz```
* ```cd redis-5.0.3```

You will then need to run ```make```, however, in order to do this, you first need to have the X Code Command Line Tools installed on your Mac. You can install these by (Note: *only* the XCode Command Line Tools will be installed, not all of XCode): 

```xcode-select --install```

Agree to the T&Cs and follows the prompts. Once installed, in your redis folder run: 

* ```make```. 
* Thereafter, run ```make test``` to ensure all is well! 


#### Redis

Once setup, ```cd src```, in src, run ```redis-server```. This will get your Redis server running. 

In a new Terminal (Ctrl + T), cd into your redis/src folder again and run: ```redis-cli```. 

Once in the CLI, you can run your Redis commands: 

#### Redis Commands

* INFO // give you your Redis server info
* CONFIG GET * // returns all Redis keys
* CONFIG GET databases // returns all dbs
* SELECT 0 // will select the first db
* KEYS * // will return all keys in a db
