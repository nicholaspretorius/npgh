I have been trying out [Substack](https://www.substack.com). In short, it is a subscription email newsletter/blog service that enables you to write and publish newsletters quickly, easily and charge for them (via Stripe) if you like. They are also busy experimenting with delivering podcasts too. 

Thoughts: 

* The editor is clean and minimal - I like it.
* There is no "Saves as Draft" button. Which is terribly weird and confusing. 
* The "one line description" of the site is not displayed - also confusing. (Maybe it appears if you upload a logo?)
* The customisation options are limited, but considering this is a beta and MVP, understood. 
* Are there RSS feeds?
* The editor does not make it obvious how to add the various social media embeds. 
* A 'dark mode' would be nice!

I like the product. 

It is simple and staightforward. The look and feel reminds me of Medium to some extent, but this is not a bad thing.
