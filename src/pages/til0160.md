Below are some useful commands when working with AWS Elasic Beanstalk (EB):

* `eb init --profile profile_name_here` Initialises the EB environment (will create a .elasticbeanstalk folder with a config.yml file within it)
* `eb list --all` Lists all eb environments if any
* `eb create --profile profile_name_here`
* `eb deploy --profile profile_name_here`
* `eb terminate --all` to terminate Elastic Beanstalk environments
* `eb abort` to cancel an active eb operation

Your AWS credentials file should contain something like the following: 

```
[profile_name_here]
aws_access_key_id=keygoeshere
aws_secret_access_key=tokengoeshere
aws_session_token=tokengoeshere
```
