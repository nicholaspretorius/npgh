These are the podcasts I have been listening to of late: 

### TechMeme Ride Home.

Being a web developer, and having more than a passing interest in the broader technology industry, the Tech Meme Ride Home is a great way to keep in touch with the ongoing news in the sector. At only about 15-20 minutes long. It is easy to listen to while doing other things like cooking or cleaning up. 

### The Daily. 

The Daily is an incredibly well produced show by The New York Times. There is one episode, Monday to Friday, typically digging into a big story of the moment. I feel it is a good way to get an overview and understanding of some of the larger news stories of the moment. 

### The Talk Show with John Gruber.

As a long time Daring Fireball listener, this one is a no-brainer. A long form, discussion style podcast that has been runningn for many years. I believe this show is the first podcast I listened to back when it was still part of the 5by5 network. At the time, John and his former co-host Dan were, at the end of each show, discussing one of the James Bond films as they watched them. As a fan of tech and Bond, it was a great combination. I have been listening on and off since. 

### The Tim Ferris Show. 

While I have not been listening as often as I used to, the Tim Ferris Show used to be one of my staple shows. The recent interview with Neil Gaiman was incredible though. I highly recommend it, especially if you are a fan of Gaiman's writing. Neil, for those who don't know, is the author of books such as American Gods, Anansi Boys, Neverwhere and The Graveyard Book. All of which I have listened to in audiobook format.
