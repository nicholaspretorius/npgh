I have slowly been getting back to using WordPress. My interest has been re-kindled for the following reasons: 

1. Considering the ever-increasing power of the large social-media giants and their related controversies, I feel that the WordPress mission of democratizing publishing on the web is more important than ever. 
2. I want to find a way to contribute back to a community that learned so much from and have benefitted from in my own life. 
3. After several years working in the JavaScript and REST API world, the emergence of the WP REST API shines a new light on possibilities of using WordPress in new ways. 
4. Since using Gatsby and GraphQL for my 'Today I Leared' GitHub page, I am intrigued by the WP GraphQL plugin. 
5. My recent dive into using Glide to build mobile apps has got me thinking of ways to incorporate WordPress content into Glide workflows so that people using WordPress can find new ways to present their content to their customers.
